Installation 
============

This file provides an overview of the installation process. For more
detailed notes from an example installation, see docs/install-notes.txt. 
If you want to skip right to the BIND installation, see INSTALL.BIND (to
which these instructions refer at the appropriate time).

If a step uses files included with this distribution, those files are listed
below that step.

1. Install Ubuntu Server, installing LAMP and OpenSSH, but not BIND.
2. Set and record password for MySQL "root" user.
3. Update all packages.
4. Review all files in this distribution, changing "school" as desired and
   changing lines marked with #-#.
5. Set root password.
6. Install packages listed in build/dpkg-list.
    = build/dpkg-list
7. Configure network interfaces, if installing primary and secondary servers.
   Add the -primary contents to the primary DNS server, the -secondary to the 
   secondary DNS server.
    = etc/network/interfaces-primary
    = etc/network/interfaces-secondary
8. Configure iptables, including redirection to dedicated log file and log 
   rotation.
    = etc/iptables.rules
9. Install BIND with support for Dynamically-Loadable Zones (DLZs). 
   For details, see INSTALL.BIND - it covers in detail what this file does
   in steps 9 - 13.
10. Configure BIND for DLZs using both etc/bind/named.conf.options_[12] files.
    These are used for updating one table while the other is in use, and is
    independent of whether you're configuring a primary or secondary too.
    Install standard zone files (these are from Ubuntu).
    = etc/bind/named.conf.options_1
    = etc/bind/named.conf.options_2
    = etc/bind/named.conf
    = etc/bind/named.conf.default-zones
    = etc/bind/db.0
    = etc/bind/db.127
    = etc/bind/db.255
    = etc/bind/db.local
    = etc/bind/db.root
11. Create database objects in MySQL using sql/*.sql.
    = sql/malware_domains.sql
    = sql/statistics.sql
12. Install malware domain update scripts and set to run from cron as bind.
    = home/bind/safedns/blacklist.txt
    = home/bind/safedns/blacklist
    = home/bind/safedns/load_malware_domains.sh
    = home/bind/safedns/validate_and_load.pl
    = home/bind/safedns/whitelist.txt
    = home/bind/safedns/whitelist
    = var/spool/cron/crontabs/bind
13. Start BIND, making sure it starts *after* MySQL.
    = etc/init/bind9.conf
14. Configure Apache to handle all 404 errors and to omit IP addresses and
    referer from logs. The .part files provided should be incorporated into
    existing files. Edit landing page (index.html) as desired and install in 
    DocumentRoot.
    = etc/apache2/apache2.conf.part
    = etc/apache2/httpd.conf.part
    = etc/apache2/sites-available/anonrequesters
    = usr/local/sbin/aggregate-referer
    = usr/local/sbin/prune-error
    = var/www/index.html
15. Edit and publish documentation as desired:
    = docs/safedns-config.html (details of system and service configuration)
    = docs/safedns-tasks.html (instructions for ongoing administrative tasks)
    = docs/safedns-pilot.html (public page, incl. Terms of Svc, Privacy Stmt)
