Boot from Ubuntu Server 10.04 32-bit(!) Installation DVD, making sure it's not 
a rewritable disk - the drive is too old to boot from it.
Install Ubuntu Server, selecting all defaults until defining the hostname:
Hostname: safedns[12] (1 or 2 depending on which node it is)
Partitioning: Guided - use entire disk (no LVM)
Partition disks: confirm that changes should be written to disk (at both 
partition and formatting prompts).
Base system will be installed.
Create a user account for the user "security"
Managing updates: select automatic security updates
Software selection: Install LAMP and OpenSSH.
Set password for MySQL "root" user
After reboot
----
In case of error "Gave up waiting for root device" occurs:
type "exit" at (initfs) prompt
sudo vi /etc/default/grub
change:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet" to
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="rootdelay=90 quiet splash"
and then run:
sudo update-grub
exit

(Settings that were attempted but ruled out were: BIOS set so Embedded AIC-7899,
A::00 SEAGAGE ST3146707LC is before System BIOS boot devices in the Hard-Disk 
Drive Sequence; and Hard Disk first in boot order)

----
Log in as security
sudo aptitude safe-upgrade (answering Y to any prompts about installing pkgs)
sudo reboot

SSH in as security
sudo passwd root
[set password]

If not added already, or user security has wrong permissions, here's how
to create the user manually:
- sudo useradd -c "Info Security" -m -r -s /bin/bash security
- sudo usermod -G adm,dialout,cdrom,plugdev,lpadmin,sambashare,admin security
- sudo passwd security

configure etc/network/interfaces, including iptables (see files from dist) 
[follow directions in dist/README to install distribution]

Install BIND
Decide on version of BIND:
- BIND 9.8.0 (!) was released on March 1, 2011, with some support for DLZs.
As of March 10, 2011, it may be too early to deploy this version in production.
- BIND 9.7.1 fails to start/run when DLZ is enabled
Mar 11 10:36:34 safedns1 named[19447]: Loading 'Mysql zone' using driver mysql
Mar 11 10:36:34 safedns1 named[19447]: Required token %zone% not found.
Mar 11 10:36:34 safedns1 named[19447]: Could not build find zone query list
Mar 11 10:36:34 safedns1 named[19447]: mysql driver could not create database in
stance object.
Mar 11 10:36:34 safedns1 kernel: [675814.157351] named[19451]: segfault at 2c ip
 00a280d6 sp b6003ea0 error 4 in named[9c9000+76000]

- BIND 9.6-ESV-R2 works with DLZ, but it's not available via source from apt-get

So install 9.6-ESV-R2 from source and enable DLZ:
mkdir -p /usr/local/src/bind9
cd /usr/local/src/bind9
apt-get install fakeroot bison dpkg-dev
apt-get install libkrb5-dev debhelper libssl-dev libtool libdb-dev libldap2-dev libxml2-dev libcap2-dev hardening-wrapper libgeoip-dev libmysqlclient-dev
dpkg -i *.deb
apt-get source bind9
cd bind9-9.7.0.dfsg.P1

#the line, not changing to =yes or =/usr/bin/mysql or anything else!)

- Copy section of /boot/grub/grub.cfg to /etc/grub.d/40_custom,
changing UUID to whatever blkid reports for the /backup partition. 
- Edit /etc/default/grub, commenting out GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 and
setting GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET to false.

Create /etc/rsyslog.d/30-iptables.conf to redirect iptables DNS log messages
to /var/log/iptables.log (only) for ease of log review and processing of stats.

*** Note - rsyslogd does NOT reread its configuration files upon HUP. Must
send TERM instead.

apt-get install rcs

Add /var/log/iptables.log to /etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog after /var/log/messages

To bring up secondary interface:
Configure the IP address you want added in /etc/network/interfaces as eth0:2
ifup eth0:2

To bring down secondary interface:
ifdown eth0:2

To move IP address between hosts:
ifdown eth0:2 # on FROM host
ifup eth0:2 # on TO host
arping -U -I eth0 [IP]
