<body>
<h2>SafeDNS Pilot</h2>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
It has become increasingly difficult to protect client workstations from
becoming compromised by malicious software. Even if workstations are 
patched and running up-to-date anti-virus software, some risks remain 
because of the:
<ul>
<li>Increasing prevalence of 0-day threats (attacks that exploit
vulnerabilities for which there is no patch);
</li><li>Incomplete effectiveness of anti-virus software in detecting polymorphic 
malware; and 
</li><li>Prevalence of malicious third-party ads hosted on otherwise legitimate 
web sites.
</li></ul>
<h3>The Pilot</h3>
<p>
<em>You are invited</em> to participate in this pilot service intended to 
protect client workstations at School from becoming infected by computers 
known to host malware. On a daily basis, this service updates a list of 
about 20,000 hosts that are known to be hosting malicious software. 

</p>
<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>
If a workstation is configured to use this as the DNS service, any attempt to
reach a suspected malicious host gets redirected to
the SafeDNS server itself. Web requests from the workstation will go here:
<a href="http://safedns1.school.edu/">http://safedns[12].school.edu/</a> instead of to a malicious host.
</p>
<h3>How do I join?</h3>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>If you're a Local Support Provider, feel free to try out the service 
yourself by setting your DNS server addresses as follows:<br>
<b>Primary:</b> a1.b1.c1.d1<br> <!- #-#>

<b>Secondary:</b> a2.b2.c2.d2 <!- #-#>
</li><li>Review the Terms of Service, below.
</li><li>When you're ready to set up clients to use the service, 
contact Support (<a href="mailto:itsupport@school.edu">itsupport@school.edu</a>), letting them know:
<ul>
<li>How many clients you'd like to add, so we can confirm that the service is
ready to support that number; and
</li><li>Whether you'd like to be added to a distribution list for outage 
notifications and notices about service changes or enhancements.
</li></ul>
</li><li>Once we confirm that the service is ready for you to join, distribute the
Privacy Statement below to your users.
</li><li>Reconfigure clients to use the DNS server addresses above.
</li><li>Give us feedback about the rate of compromises before and after joining
the pilot (as described in the Terms of Service, below). Contact  
Support if you see any false positives.
</li></ol> 
<p></p>
<h3>Terms of Service</h3>

<ul>
<li>While we have made reasonable efforts to provide a robust and reliable
pilot service, it is provided on a best-effort basis, with no guarantees
about uptime, protection from false positives, or true negatives.
</li><li>The pilot service should not be used by servers, only client 
computers. For example, a system running a mail or web server should not
 use the pilot service.
</li><li>Unlike School's production DNS servers, the SafeDNS pilot servers 
do NOT receive updates from the DNS management system immediately. Thus, if 
you need to change a server's DNS records, make sure you lower the TTL 
<em>in advance</em> of the 
change to make sure any old entry is expired more quickly from the SafeDNS 
cache.
</li><li>Participation in the pilot is free. In the event it becomes a production
service, it may be necessary to pay to use the service.
</li><li>As a condition of participation in the pilot, you agree to 
provide us with (1) reports of any subscribing clients that become 
compromised; and (2) a comparison to the rate of compromise prior to 
subscribing to the service, e.g. x number of computers compromised per 
week or month.
</li><li>Depending on the feedback received during and after the pilot, 
it may be either discontinued or turned into a production service.
</li><li>You agree to notify users subscribed to the service of the privacy statement we provide to you.
</li></ul>
<h3>What We Log</h3>
<p>
Only the information necessary to run or support the
service is logged. For example, even though all DNS requests go to the 
server, the requests themselves (e.g. for www.google.com) are not logged. 
</p>
<h3>Privacy Statement</h3>

<p>
The SafeDNS service reduces the likelihood that a computer will be 
compromised through web browsing. The service does this by tracking web 
sites known to be the source of malicious content. If the computer 
attempts to reach such a site in the course of web browsing or other 
activity, the service will redirect the computer to a safe location. In 
the course of providing this service, certain information is tracked for 
the purpose of measuring effectiveness. The information tracked includes 
the IP address of the subscribed computer and the time of the activity. 
The initial site (from which the computer was directed to the malicious 
site) is also recorded, but without information that would link the 
subscribed computer to the initial site.
