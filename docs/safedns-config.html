<h3>Important Notes</h3><a name="notes"></a>
The DNS service (BIND) must 
<ul>
<li>be kept at a version that actually works with
Dynamically-Loadable Zones (DLZ) using the MySQL database, which is why 
BIND 9.6-ESV-R2 was built from source (package was not available). 
BIND 9.8.0 contains some support for DLZs but was not tested due to its 
being an early release as of the date the server was built. 
BIND 9.7.1 is known not to work (it fails to start or run with DLZ enabled).
<li>Your system may require that BIND run single-threaded (named -n 1) - if
you find that it crashes when doing performance testing, it may be that
it cannot handle queries in parallel;
</ul>
<h3>Overview</h3><a name="overview"></a>
<p>
The SafeDNS service consists of two hosts:<br>
<pre>
safedns1.domain
safedns2.domain
</pre>
running DNS (BIND) with Dynamically-Loadable Zones (DLZ) using MySQL as
the repository for domain names. This is necessary due to the large (~300,000)
number of them. The list of malware domains is updated nightly.
</p>
<p>
<em>However</em>, DNS service is actually advertised as being on the virtual
interfaces named:<br>
<pre>
safedns1-svc.domain
safedns2-svc.domain
</pre>
which as of this writing, were A1.B1.C1.D1 and A2.B2.C2.D2, respectively.
<p>
A web server (Apache) is also running. Any requests made to the web server for
a malicious domain it claims to be hosting will be fetched from the actual
malicious host on a nightly basis, for later analysis.
</p>
<p>
Services are restricted to campus subnets using iptables. 
</p>
<h3>Triage</h3><a name="triage"></a>
<p>
If DNS isn't running, it can be restarted like this:
<pre>
/usr/sbin/named -u bind -n 1
</pre>
See also <a href="#trouble">Troubleshooting</a>, below.
</p>

<h3>Network Configuration</h3>
Each SafeDNS server has two interfaces defined in 
<tt>/etc/network/interfaces</tt>: 
<ul>
<li><b><tt>eth0</tt></b>: 
<ul>
<li>primary interface
<li>NOT published/announced to users
<li>automatically configured at boot 
<li>safedns[12].domain
<li>persistent address regardless of role the server is playing (primary
or secondary)
<li>the address you should connect to when moving interfaces 
around when doing a failover
</ul>
<li><b><tt>eth0:1</tt></b>:
<ul>
<li>primary virtual interface
<li>IS published/announced to users
<li>automatically configured at boot 
<li>safedns[12]-svc.domain
<li>address that can be moved around, depending on role the server is 
playing (primary or secondary)
<li>NOT the address you should connect to when moving interfaces 
around when doing a failover
</ul>
<li><b><tt>eth0:2</tt></b>:
<ul>
<li>secondary virtual interface
<li>only published/announced to users as side effect of failover process
<li>NOT automatically configured at boot 
<li>safedns[12]-svc.domain
<li>interface to bring up if failing over IP address
<li>NOT the address you should connect to when moving interfaces 
around when doing a failover
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Failover and Recovery</h3><a name="failover"></a>
<h4>Fail primary or secondary service over to another host</h4>
While failover happens at the client level, there may be a perceptible delay.
To avoid this, fail service over to a working host:
<ul>
<li>Each system can assume the IP address of the other using the configuration in
<tt>/etc/network/interfaces</tt>. Make sure there is a manual entry listing 
the IP address to be added. 
<li>To verify the state of things, make sure to review 
<tt>/etc/network/interfaces</tt>
and the output of <tt>ifconfig -a</tt> before moving the IP address around.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>To take a host out of service generally</h4>
<ul>  
<li>Use <tt>dig @server_ip hostname</tt> for a few hosts (on-campus, 
off-campus, malicious) to verify lookups happening correctly before 
maintenance.
<li>On personal workstation, start a ping of <tt>server_ip</tt>.
<li>On the host to be taken out of service: <tt>ifdown eth0:1</tt> 
<li>On the host to add <tt>server_ip</tt> to:<br>
<tt>ifup eth0:2</tt> (takes a few seconds) <br>
<tt>arping -U -I eth0 server_ip</tt> 
<li>As soon as <tt>server_ip</tt> becomes pingable again press Ctrl-C to stop 
the arping.
<li>Use <tt>dig @server_ip hostname</tt> again to make sure DNS service is 
working for that moved IP. If not, do <tt>rndc reload</tt> on the host where
<tt>server_ip</tt> was added.
<li><em>If out-of-service host needs to be rebooted:</em> change <tt>eth0:1</tt> entry from <tt>auto</tt> to <tt>manual</tt> in <tt>/etc/network/interfaces</tt> and reboot (takes about 4 minutes).
</ul>
<h4>To put a host back in service generally</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>If host was rebooted while out of service:</em> 
<ul>
<li>Change <tt>eth0:1</tt> entry back to <tt>auto</tt> in <tt>/etc/network/interfaces</tt>.
<li>Run <tt>service bind9 start</tt> to start DNS service (it's configured
in <tt>/etc/init/bind9.conf</tt> not to start unless both interfaces are up).
<li>Use <tt>dig @server_ip hostname</tt> (where <tt>server_ip</tt> is the IP
address associated with the eth0 interface of the host to be brought back in
service!) for a few hosts (on-campus, off-campus, 
malicious) to verify lookups happening correctly.
</ul>
<li>On the host to relinquish the IP: <tt>ifdown eth0:2</tt>
<li>On the host to take back on the IP:<br>
<tt>ifup eth0:1</tt> (takes a few seconds)<br>
<tt>arping -U -I eth0 [IP_address being re-assumed]</tt> 
<li>Press Ctrl-C to stop the <tt>arping</tt> when the IP address is pingable.
<li>Do an <tt>rndc reload</tt> on both hosts for good measure (sometimes
BIND doesn't handle the change of interfaces gracefully).
<li>Use <tt>dig @server_ip hostname</tt> for a few hosts (on-campus, off-campus, 
malicious) to verify lookups happening correctly after maintenance.
<li>Use <tt>tail -f /var/log/iptables.log</tt> on both hosts to make sure 
queries are being processed.
</ul>
</p>
<h4>To boot from the backup root disk</h4>
<p>
Primary root disk is <tt>/dev/sda</tt>. Backup boot disk is <tt>/dev/sdb</tt>. 
<ul>
<li>From console, reboot. 
<li>At GRUB screen (a list of bootable images) select the 
very last one in the list.
</ul>
A reboot will automatically boot from the primary root disk.
</p>
<h4>To update the backup copy of the root disk</h4>
<p>
<pre>
# obliterate whatever is on the backup disk now
mkfs.ext3 -L /backup /dev/sdb1
# mount the new filesystem on /backup
mount /dev/sdb1 /backup
# then dump the filesystem on the primary disk to the backup disk
dump -0 -f - /dev/sda1 | (cd /backup && restore -rf -)
</pre>
</p>
<h4>To install new version of BIND DNS</h4>
<p>
See instructions in the <a href="install-notes.txt">installation notes</a>, 
from &quot;Install BIND&quot; through &quot;service bind9 start.&quot;
</p>
<h3>Users &amp; Passwords</h3><a name="creds"></a>
<ul>
<li><b>Users</b>: 
<ul>
<li><b>OS</b>: <tt>security</tt> (with sudo privs - it's convenient to use <tt>sudo -s</tt> to have a sudo shell). Other users were added automatically by 
packages when they were installed. 
<li><b>MySQL</b>: <tt>root</tt>, <tt>bind</tt>, and <tt>stat</tt>.
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Cron jobs</h3><a name="cron"></a>
They are offset on safedns1 and safedns2 so that in case there's a problem
detected with one, it might be detected in time to prevent it from propagating
to the other.
<h4>safedns1</h4>
<pre>
security:
30 22 * * * /home/security/fetch/fetch-all
00 23 * * * /home/security/analyze/analyze-feeds.pl

root:
41 1 * * * /root/safedns/update/load_malware_domains.sh > /root/safedns/update/last_load.log 2>&1
0 22 * * * /bin/cp /var/log/apache2/custom.log /home/security/fetch; chown security /home/security/fetch/custom.log
</pre>
<h4>safedns2</h4>
<pre>
security:
30 10 * * * /home/security/fetch/fetch-all
00 11 * * * /home/security/analyze/analyze-feeds.pl

root:
41 13 * * * /root/safedns/update/load_malware_domains.sh > /root/safedns/update/last_load.log 2>&1
0 10 * * * /bin/cp /var/log/apache2/custom.log /home/security/fetch; chown security /home/security/fetch/custom.log
</pre>

<h3>Malware Domain Load Process</h3><a name="mdlp"></a>
<p>
<b><tt>/root/safedns/update</tt></b> contains the supporting scripts and configuration files for the SafeDNS service, of which
<b><tt>load_malware_domains.sh</tt></b> runs daily from root's cron:
<ul>
<li>Downloading the latest copy of the malware domain lists from Malware Domains, Zeus Tracker, SRI's Most Observed Malware-Related DNS Names, and REN-ISAC;
<li>Adding hostnames from blacklist.txt, removing those from whitelist.txt, 
and removing school.edu;
<li>Doing a sanity check to make sure the new lists don't differ by more than 
25% from the previous day's; and
<li>Loading the records into MySQL, and reloading DNS if appropriate. 
<ul>
<li>Two tables are used alternately
in MySQL, so one table can be used for production queries while the other 
has its records deleted and then populated. 
<li>After they are populated, BIND
is told to use the configuration file that points to the updated table. 
</ul>
<li>Note: there is a hidden dependency in the script - when it does a wget of the REN-ISAC
feed, it uses the credentials configured in <tt>/root/.wgetrc</tt>. If you try 
to run the wget using sudo, the credentials in <tt>~security/.wgetrc</tt> will 
be used instead.
<li>The Apache logs are copied to the security user's directory daily,
for processing by its analyze-feeds.pl cron job (see above). This tracks
which requested domains appeared in which feed, for later determination of
false positives and false negatives.
<li><b><tt>blacklist.txt</tt>:</b> contains fully-qualified hostnames or domains to blacklist manually (i.e. in addition to those provided by the automated feeds);
<li><b><tt>whitelist.txt</tt>:</b> contains fully-qualified hostnames or domains to be whitelisted, aside from school.edu, which is already whitelisted via the script that 
builds the malware domain list
<li><b><tt>validate_and_load_alt.pl</tt>:</b> this is called from load_malware_domains.sh; it 
validates the names to ensure they're well-formed (to prevent mischief) and 
adds them to the local MySQL database, associating them with a pre-defined IP 
address (of the walled garden web server, as defined in the script). 
</ul>

<h3>System Files Customized or Added </h3><a name="files"></a>
<p>
The files customized or added in order to configure the system are on 
<tt>probe:~security/backup/safedns/safedns[12]-preprod-dist.tar</tt>. The list of 
installed packages is in the same directory, as <tt>dpkg.list</tt> (which is 
the output of <tt>dpkg --list</tt>).

<h3>Frequent Tasks</h3><a name="tasks"></a>
<p>
Instructions for blacklisting, whitelisting, refreshing a DNS record, 
and rebooting are detailed 
<a href="safedns-tasks.html">here</a>.
</p>
<h3>Database Structure</h3><a name="db"></a>
<ul>
<li><a href="malware_domains.sql">malware_domains.sql</a> defines the tables
in the database malware_domains (dns_records_1 &amp; dns_records_2) and the
associated procedures (insert_1 and insert_2).
<li><a href="statistics.sql">statistics.sql</a> defines the table
in the database statistics (referers) and the
associated procedure (increment_count).
</ul>
<h3>Manual Database Modifications</h3><a name="database"></a>
<p>
<b>To log into MySQL</b> to manipulate the database manually, log into 
safedns[12].domain and connect to mysql:
<pre>
mysql --user=bind --password
[enter password as defined in /etc/bind/named.conf.options]
use malware_domains;
[enter SQL commands, then type quit to exit]
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<b>To remove a particular host or domain</b> X.Y.Z from the database (i.e. remove it 
from the blacklist), after connecting to MySQL (see above):
<pre>
delete from dns_records
where zone like 'X.Y.Z';
</pre>
and then (if desired) add it to the whitelist.txt file to prevent it from being 
re-added during the nightly load.
</p>
<p>
<b>To remove ALL records</b> from the database (to start from scratch, although leaving
users exposed), after connecting to MySQL (see above):
<pre>
delete from dns_records;
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<b>To re-populate the database</b> using the current malware domain list, log into
safedns[12].domain, and as root, run 
<tt>/root/safedns/update/load_malware_domains.sh</tt>.

<h3>Logging</h3><a name="log"></a>
<ul>
<li><b>DNS queries:</b> There is a line in <tt>safedns[12]:/var/log/iptables.log</tt> for 
each DNS query received, identifying only the client's IP and MAC address, 
not the content of the query itself. Entries look like this:
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<li><b>HTTP requests:</b> each request for a malware domain URL is logged to
<tt>safedns:/var/log/apache2/custom.log</tt>.
<li><b>Referers:</b> are added to a MySQL table (via a CustomLog directive
in the Apache configuration), but the only other identifying information is
the day, with the intention of breaking correlation with the more granualar
query information in the Apache logs. The is the <a href="referer-insert.txt">relevant SQL</a>.

<h3>Security Updates</h3><a name="patches"></a> 
<p>
Updates are installed automatically on a daily basis, although any 
required reboots are not. 
These settings are defined in <tt>safedns[12]:/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic</tt> and <tt>safedns:/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades</tt>. See 
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates">Ubuntu 
Documentation</a> for more information.

<h3>Server Build</h3><a name="build"></a> 
<ul>
<li><b>DNS:</b> Build Bind (DNS) to use Dynamically-Loadable Zones (DLZ), 
with MySQL as the datbase back-end using 
<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=823578">Ubuntu Forums

<h3>Obscure Errors that were Fixed</h3><a name="errors"></a>
<h4>Gave up waiting for root device</h4>
<p>
This occurred when building the system, and was because SCSI disks take
longer to spin up, and the BIOS wasn't waiting long enough. To fix:
<pre>
type "exit" at (initfs) prompt
sudo vi /etc/default/grub
change:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet" to

This is known to happen with BIND version 9.7.1, and may occur with other
versions. As of June 7, 2011, the only BIND version known to work with DLZ
was 9.6-ESV-R2. BIND 9.8.0 was not tested, given the newness of the release.
