<h3>Important BIND Notes</h3><a name="notes"></a>
<ul>
<li>The BIND service must be configured to use
Dynamically-Loadable Zones (DLZ) using the MySQL database, which is why 
it likely will have to be built from source.
<ul>
<li>BIND 9.9.1-P1 is known to work.
<li>BIND 9.6-ESV-R2 is known to work.
</ul>
<li>The error &quot;Required token $zone$ not found.&quot; is an indication 
that the /etc/bind/named.conf.options_[12] file must have $ instead of 
% around the variables. This seems to have changed between BIND 9.6 and 
BIND 9.7. See <a href="http://diaryproducts.net/about/operating_systems/unix/installing_bind9_with_dlz_and_mysql_backend_on_ubuntu_jaunty_9_04">this</a> 
helpful post from Hannes Schmidt.
<li>Your system may require that BIND run single-threaded (named -n 1) - if
you find that it crashes when doing performance testing, it may be that
it cannot handle queries in parallel;
</ul>
<h3>Overview</h3><a name="overview"></a>
<ul>
<li>The SafeDNS service consists of two hosts:<br>
<pre>
safedns1.school.edu
safedns2.school.edu
</pre>
<em>However</em>, DNS service is actually advertised as being on the virtual
interfaces named:<br>
<pre>
safedns1-svc.school.edu
safedns2-svc.school.edu
</pre>
which are public1.B1.C1.D1 and public2.B2.C2.D2, 
respectively.
<li>They run DNS (BIND) with Dynamically-Loadable Zones (DLZ) using MySQL as
the repository for domain names. This is necessary due to the large (~20,000 or ~300,000)
number of them. 
<li>The list of malware domains is updated nightly.
<li>A web server (Apache) is also running. 
<li>Services are restricted to campus subnets using iptables. 
</ul>
<h3>Triage</h3><a name="triage"></a>
<ul>
<li>If DNS isn't running, it can be restarted like this:
<pre>
/usr/sbin/named -u bind -n 1
</pre>
<li>If DNS responds to some domain requests but not others, e.g. cached requests
but new requests, BIND is not seeing the network properly. Try:
<pre>
rndc reconfig
</pre>
</ul>

<h3>Network Configuration</h3>
Each SafeDNS server has two interfaces defined in 
<tt>/etc/network/interfaces</tt>: 
<ul>
<li><b><tt>eth0</tt></b>: 
<ul>
<li>primary interface
<li>NOT published/announced to users
<li>automatically configured at boot 
<li>safedns[12].school.edu
<li>persistent address regardless of role the server is playing (primary
or secondary)
<li>the address you should connect to when moving interfaces 
around when doing a failover
</ul>
<li><b><tt>eth0:1</tt></b>:
<ul>
<li>primary virtual interface
<li>IS published/announced to users
<li>automatically configured at boot 
<li>safedns[12]-svc.school.edu
<li>address that can be moved around, depending on role the server is 
playing (primary or secondary)
<li>NOT the address you should connect to when moving interfaces 
around when doing a failover
</ul>
<li><b><tt>eth0:2</tt></b>:
<ul>
<li>secondary virtual interface
<li>only published/announced to users as side effect of failover process
<li>NOT automatically configured at boot 
<li>safedns[12]-svc.school.edu
<li>interface to bring up if failing over IP address
<li>NOT the address you should connect to when moving interfaces 
around when doing a failover
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Failover and Recovery</h3><a name="failover"></a>
<h4>Fail primary or secondary service over to another host</h4>
While failover happens at the client level, there may be a perceptible delay
depending on the resolver. To avoid this, fail service over to a working host:
<ul>
<li>Each system can assume the IP address of the other using the configuration in
<tt>/etc/network/interfaces</tt>. Make sure there is a manual entry listing 
the IP address to be added. 
<li>To verify the state of things, make sure to review 
<tt>/etc/network/interfaces</tt>
and the output of <tt>ifconfig -a</tt> before moving the IP address around.
</ul>
<h4>To take a host out of service generally</h4>
<ul>  
<li>Use <tt>dig @server_ip hostname</tt> for a few hosts (on-campus, 
off-campus, malicious) to verify lookups happening correctly before 
maintenance.
<li>On personal workstation, start a ping of <tt>server_ip</tt>.
<li>On the host to be taken out of service: <tt>ifdown eth0:1</tt> 
<li>On the host to add <tt>server_ip</tt> to:<br>
<tt>ifup eth0:2</tt> (takes a few seconds) <br>
<tt>arping -U -I eth0 server_ip</tt> 
<li>As soon as <tt>server_ip</tt> becomes pingable again press Ctrl-C to stop 
the arping.
<li>Use <tt>dig @server_ip hostname</tt> again to make sure DNS service is 
working for that moved IP. If not, do <tt>rndc reload</tt> on the host where
<tt>server_ip</tt> was added.
<li><em>If out-of-service host needs to be rebooted:</em> change <tt>eth0:1</tt> entry from <tt>auto</tt> to <tt>manual</tt> in <tt>/etc/network/interfaces</tt> and reboot (takes about 4 minutes).
</ul>
<h4>To put a host back in service generally</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>If host was rebooted while out of service:</em> 
<ul>
<li>Change <tt>eth0:1</tt> entry back to <tt>auto</tt> in <tt>/etc/network/interfaces</tt>.
<li>Run <tt>service bind9 start</tt> to start DNS service (it's configured
in <tt>/etc/init/bind9.conf</tt> not to start unless both interfaces are up).
<li>Use <tt>dig @server_ip hostname</tt> (where <tt>server_ip</tt> is the IP
address associated with the eth0 interface of the host to be brought back in
service!) for a few hosts (on-campus, off-campus, 
malicious) to verify lookups happening correctly.
</ul>
<li>On the host to relinquish the IP: <tt>ifdown eth0:2</tt>
<li>On the host to take back on the IP:<br>
<tt>ifup eth0:1</tt> (takes a few seconds)<br>
<tt>arping -U -I eth0 [IP_address being re-assumed]</tt> 
<li>Press Ctrl-C to stop the <tt>arping</tt> when the IP address is pingable.
<li>Do an <tt>rndc reload</tt> on both hosts for good measure (sometimes
BIND doesn't handle the change of interfaces gracefully).
<li>Use <tt>dig @server_ip hostname</tt> for a few hosts (on-campus, off-campus, 
malicious) to verify lookups happening correctly after maintenance.
<li>Use <tt>tail -f /var/log/iptables.log</tt> on both hosts to make sure 
queries are being processed.
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Cron jobs</h3><a name="cron"></a>
They are offset on safedns1 and safedns2 so that in case there's a problem
detected with one, it might be detected in time to prevent it from propagating
to the other.
<h4>safedns1</h4>
<pre>
bind:
41 1 * * * /home/bind/safedns/load_malware_domains.sh > /home/bind/safedns/last_load.log 2>&1
</pre>
<h4>safedns2</h4>
<pre>
bind:
41 13 * * * /home/bind/safedns/load_malware_domains.sh > /home/bind/safedns/last_load.log 2>&1
</pre>

<h3>Malware Domain Load Process</h3><a name="mdlp"></a>
<p>
<b><tt>/home/bind/safedns</tt></b> contains the supporting scripts and configuration files for the SafeDNS service, of which:
<ul>
<li><b><tt>load_malware_domains.sh</tt></b> runs daily from bind's cron:
<ul>
<li>Downloading the latest copy of the malware domain lists from Malware Domains, Zeus Tracker, and REN-ISAC;
<li>Adding hostnames from blacklist.txt, removing those from whitelist.txt, 
and removing school.edu;
<li>Doing a sanity check to make sure the new lists don't differ by more than 
25% from the previous day's; and
<li>Loading the records into MySQL, and reloading DNS if appropriate. 
<li>Two tables are used alternately
in MySQL, so one table can be used for production queries while the other 
has its records deleted and then populated. 
<li>After they are populated, BIND
is told to use the configuration file that points to the updated table. 
</ul>
<li><b><tt>blacklist.txt</tt>:</b> contains fully-qualified hostnames or domains to blacklist manually (i.e. in addition to those provided by the automated feeds);
<li><b><tt>whitelist.txt</tt>:</b> contains fully-qualified hostnames or domains to be whitelisted, aside from school.edu, which is already whitelisted via the script that 
builds the malware domain list
<li><b><tt>validate_and_load_alt.pl</tt>:</b> this is called from load_malware_domains.sh; it 
validates the names to ensure they're well-formed (to prevent mischief) and 
adds them to the local MySQL database, associating them with a pre-defined IP 
address (of the walled garden web server, as defined in the script). 
</ul>

<h3>Frequent Tasks</h3><a name="tasks"></a>
<p>
Instructions for blacklisting, whitelisting, refreshing a DNS record, 
and rebooting are detailed 
<a href="safedns-tasks.html">here</a>.
</p>
<h3>Database Structure</h3><a name="db"></a>
<ul>
<li><a href="../sql/malware_domains.sql">malware_domains.sql</a> defines the tables
in the database malware_domains (dns_records_1 &amp; dns_records_2) and the
associated procedures (insert_1 and insert_2).
<li><a href="../sql/statistics.sql">statistics.sql</a> defines the table
in the database statistics (referers) and the
associated procedure (increment_count).
</ul>
<h3>Manual Database Modifications</h3><a name="database"></a>
<p>
<b>To log into MySQL</b> to manipulate the database manually, log into 
safedns[12].school.edu and connect to mysql:
<pre>
mysql --user=bind --password
[enter password as defined in /etc/bind/named.conf.options]
use malware_domains;
[enter SQL commands, then type quit to exit]
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<b>To remove a particular host or domain</b> X.Y.Z from the database (i.e. remove it 
from the blacklist), after connecting to MySQL (see above):
<pre>
delete from dns_records
where zone like 'X.Y.Z';
</pre>
and then (if desired) add it to the whitelist.txt file to prevent it from being 
re-added during the nightly load.
</p>
<p>
<b>To remove ALL records</b> from the database (to start from scratch, although leaving
users exposed), after connecting to MySQL (see above):
<pre>
delete from dns_records;
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<b>To re-populate the database</b> using the current malware domain list, log into
safedns[12].school.edu, and as bind, run 
<tt>/home/bind/safedns/load_malware_domains.sh</tt>.

<h3>Logging</h3><a name="log"></a>
<ul>
<li><b>DNS queries:</b> There is a line in <tt>safedns[12]:/var/log/iptables.log</tt> for 
each DNS query received, identifying only the client's IP and MAC address, 
not the content of the query itself. Entries look like this:
<blockquote>
Nov 30 10:29:28 safedns kernel: [1016208.782262] iptables DNS: IN=eth0 OUT= MAC=00:01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:10:11:12:13 SRC=x.x.x.x DST=public2.B2.C2.D2 LEN=69 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=252 ID=12345 PROTO=UDP SPT=12345 DPT=53 LEN=49 
</blockquote>
<li><b>Referers:</b> are added to a MySQL table (via a CustomLog directive
in the Apache configuration), but the only other identifying information is
the date.
