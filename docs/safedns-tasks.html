<h2>SafeDNS: Maintenance</h2>
<h4>Ad hoc tasks</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Blacklist</b> a domain: log in to each safedns1 and safedns2 as the bind 
user, and run:
<blockquote>
<tt>blacklist</tt> <em>domain</em>
</blockquote>
where <em>domain</em> is the fully-qualified domain name to be blacklisted. 
It will be added to the currently-active list of domains (which you can verify
by looking up the domain using dig or nslookup) and the file containing 
domains to be blacklisted every night.
<li><b>Whitelist</b> a domain: log in to each safedns1 and safedns2 as the
bind user and run:
<blockquote>
<tt>whitelist</tt> <em>domain</em>
</blockquote>
where <em>domain</em> is the fully-qualified domain name to be whitelisted. 
It will be removed from the currently-active list of domains (which you can verify
by looking up the domain using dig or nslookup) and the file containing 
domains to be whitelisted every night.
<li><b>Remove hostname from DNS cache</b>: if someone complains that the
SafeDNS server(s) are not seeing a change that was made to a host in
the campus DNS management system, it's most likely because they didn't 
reduce the TTL in order to allow the record update to propagae. To work 
around this, flush the 
<em>hostname</em> from the SafeDNS cache: 
<blockquote>
<tt>rndc flushname </tt><em>hostname</em>
</blockquote>
replacing <em>hostname</em> appropriately. This must be done on both safedns1 and 
safedns2.
</ul>
<h4>To reboot safedns1</h4>
<p>
This assumes safedns1-svc still has the IP address 
public1.B1.C1.D1. You should always connect to safedns[12] 
(admin[12].B[12].C[12].D[12]), not safedns[12]-svc 
(public[12].B[12].C[12].D[12]), since the -svc
IP address is the one you're moving around, and you don't want to disconnect
yourself.
</p>
<ol> 
<li>Use <tt>dig @public1.B1.C1.D1 hostname +short</tt> for a few hostnames (e.g. 
an on-campus host, known off-campus host, and malicious host listed in 
/home/bind/safedns/malwaredomains) to verify lookups are happening correctly.
<li>On your workstation, start a long-running ping of 
<tt>public1.B1.C1.D1</tt>.
<li>On safedns1 as root, type (but don't press enter): 
<tt>ifdown eth0:1</tt> 
<li>On safedns2 as root, type (but don't press enter): 
<tt>ifup eth0:2; arping -U -I eth0 public1.B1.C1.D1</tt> 
<li>On safedns1, press enter. As soon as the long-running ping stops
getting a response, press enter on safedns2.
<li>As soon as <tt>public1.B1.C1.D1</tt> returns pings again, press Ctrl-C 
on safedns2 to stop the arping.
<li>Do <tt>rndc reload</tt> on safedns2.
<li>Use <tt>dig @public1.B1.C1.D1 hostname +short</tt> again to make sure DNS service is 
working for that IP.
</ol>
At this point, safedns2 should be playing the role of safedns1 as well.
<ol>
<li>On safedns1, edit <tt>/etc/network/interfaces</tt>, changing 
<tt>eth0:1</tt> entry from <tt>auto</tt> to <tt>manual</tt>.
<li>Reboot safedns1 (takes about 4 minutes).
<li>When safedns1 becomes reachable again, log in and
become root.
<li>Change <tt>eth0:1</tt> entry back to <tt>auto</tt> in 
<tt>/etc/network/interfaces</tt>.
<li>On safedns2 as root, type (but don't press enter): 
<tt>ifdown eth0:2</tt>
<li>On safedns1 as root, type (but don't press enter):
<tt>ifup eth0:1; arping -U -I eth0 public1.B1.C1.D1</tt> 
<li>On safedns2, press enter. As soon as the long-running ping stops
getting a response, press enter on safedns1.
<li>Press Ctrl-C on safedns1 to stop the <tt>arping</tt> once public1.B1.C1.D1 
is pingable.
<li>Do an <tt>rndc reload</tt> on both hosts for good measure (sometimes
BIND doesn't handle the change of interfaces gracefully).
<li>Use <tt>dig @public1.B1.C1.D1 hostname +short</tt> as before,
to verify lookups are happening correctly after maintenance.
<li>Use <tt>tail -f /var/log/iptables.log</tt> on both hosts to make sure 
queries are being processed.
</ol>
At this point, safedns1 and safedns2 are back to their usual roles.
</p>

<h4>To reboot safedns2</h4>
<p>
This assumes safedns2-svc still has the IP address 
public2.B2.C2.D2. You should always connect to safedns[12] 
(admin[12].B[12].C[12].D[12]), not safedns[12]-svc 
(admin[12].B[12].C[12].D[12]), since the -svc
IP address is the one you're moving around, and you don't want to disconnect
yourself.
</p>
<ol>

an on-campus host, known off-campus host, and a malicious host listed in 
/home/bind/safedns/malwaredomains) to verify lookups are happening correctly.

<li>On safedns2, press enter. As soon as the long-running ping stops
getting a response, press enter on safedns1.
<li>As soon as <tt>public2.B2.C2.D2</tt> returns pings again, press Ctrl-C 
on safedns1 to stop the arping.
